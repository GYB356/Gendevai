# AI Skill Components Marketplace - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The AI Skill Components Marketplace is a powerful extension to the GenDevAI platform that enables:

1. Creating, sharing, and executing modular AI skills
2. Building complex workflows by connecting skills
3. Monetizing AI skills through a marketplace

## Key Components Implemented

### Database Schema
- Added comprehensive models for skills, workflows, ratings, and purchases
- Established relationships between users, skills, and workflows
- Created models to track usage statistics and execution history

### AI Skill Service
- Implemented skill execution with input validation
- Created template-based prompting system
- Added output validation against JSON schemas
- Included predefined skill examples across categories

### Workflow Engine
- Built a workflow execution engine to orchestrate skills
- Implemented node-based workflow architecture
- Added support for conditional logic
- Created event tracking for workflow execution

## Usage Examples

### Creating and Executing an AI Skill

```typescript
import { AISkillService } from "@gendevai/ai-core";

// Create a new instance of the skill service
const skillService = new AISkillService();

// Execute an existing skill
const result = await skillService.executeSkill(
  EXAMPLE_SKILLS.CODE_REVIEWER,
  {
    code: "function add(a, b) { return a + b; }",
    language: "javascript"
  }
);

console.log(result.output);
```

### Building and Running a Workflow

```typescript
import { WorkflowExecutionEngine } from "@gendevai/ai-core";

// Create a new workflow engine
const workflowEngine = new WorkflowExecutionEngine();

// Define a simple workflow
const workflow = {
  id: "code-improvement-workflow",
  name: "Code Improvement Workflow",
  description: "Analyzes code, then generates tests and documentation",
  nodes: [
    // Input node for the code
    {
      id: "code-input",
      type: "input",
      position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
      config: { name: "code" },
      connections: [{ source: "code-input", target: "code-reviewer" }]
    },
    // Code review skill
    {
      id: "code-reviewer",
      type: "skill",
      skillId: "code-reviewer",
      position: { x: 400, y: 100 },
      config: {},
      connections: [{ source: "code-reviewer", target: "test-generator" }]
    },
    // Test generation skill
    {
      id: "test-generator",
      type: "skill",
      skillId: "unit-test-generator",
      position: { x: 700, y: 100 },
      config: {},
      connections: [{ source: "test-generator", target: "output-node" }]
    },
    // Output node
    {
      id: "output-node",
      type: "output",
      position: { x: 1000, y: 100 },
      config: { name: "result" },
      connections: []
    }
  ]
};

// Execute the workflow
const result = await workflowEngine.executeWorkflow(workflow, {
  code: "function isPalindrome(str) { return str === str.split('').reverse().join(''); }"
});

console.log(result.output);
console.log(`Execution events: ${result.events.length}`);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create API Routes**: Implement REST endpoints for skill and workflow management
2. **Build UI Components**: Develop marketplace UI and workflow editor
3. **Implement Payment Integration**: Set up payment processing for monetized skills
4. **Add Analytics Dashboard**: Create visualizations for skill usage and performance
5. **Implement User Permissions**: Add role-based access control for marketplace skills
